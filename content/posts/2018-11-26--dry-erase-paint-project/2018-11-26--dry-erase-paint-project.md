Back in the summer I received Rust-Oleum dry erase paint as a birthday gift but I was only able to use it recently. I did a lot of research before I moved forward with this project so that I could get the best result and it was well worth it. Here's some of the most important points to keep in mind when doing a project like this.

Rust-Oleum dry erase paint has an expiry date and should not be used if older than a year. The package contains two cans the larger is the paint and the smaller one is the activator. There is a code on the larger of two cans that will tell you when it was made. The code varies by country and location so do a google search to find how the read the one you have.

You pour the smaller can into the larger can to be able to use the paint. It works best if you gently stir each can before mixing. Once mixed you have one to two hours to use the paint before it is no longer effective. I was easily able to get 3 coats myself in roughly 90 minutes. You want to let each coat dry for 15 to 20 minutes.

Using a dense foam roller will help reduce bubbles when applying the paint. Bubbles are bad news and cause the dry erase maker to be harder to erase and cause the ink to get caught. Cleaning the wall before hand and doing a light sanding can also help getting a nice smooth coat.

Once completed you want to let it stand for three days before using it with dry erase markers. I waited a week as I was out of town for a few days after I painted the wall. I've been extremely happy with the results. The wall I used it on is near my computer workstation and I use it to help visuals my ideas or help me work through problems. It's also great for reminders as I can see it from the places I spend most time in the house.
