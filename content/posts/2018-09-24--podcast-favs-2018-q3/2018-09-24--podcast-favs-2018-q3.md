I've really gotten into podcasts now that I have finally figured out how to use Bluetooth in my car. Honestly it was hard at all, not sure why I put it off for so long. Anyway, of the podcasts I've been listening to here are three that I really enjoy along with my favorite episode:

 1. [Fragmented](http://fragmentedpodcast.com) an Android development podcast with Donn Felker and Kaushik Gopal. As someone who has never done any Andoird development I liked this podcast as a good introduction. There are two episodes that I really enjoyed - [129](http://fragmentedpodcast.com/episodes/129) and [130](http://fragmentedpodcast.com/episodes/130) - which are both on the subject of sunsetting React Native at Airbnb with Gabriel Peal. They get deep into the details of using React Native at Airbnb and why they ended up going away from it in favor of native code - Java or Kotlin in the case of Android.
 2. [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/) with Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski covers some of the coolest web technology for developers. The host just get me excited about building things. [Episode 56](https://syntax.fm/show/056/design-systems) was especially awesome and it introduced me to the concept of design systems which I really think could be a huge win where I work and hopefully will have a blog post of their own soon.
 3. [Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm/) with Steve Dower. This is another one on a topic that I don't have much experience with, any really, but much curiosity. It's also funny that my favorite episodes are another two-parter. Episodes [173](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/173/coming-into-python-from-another-industry-part-1) and [174](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/174/coming-into-python-from-another-industry-part-2) on coming into Python from another Industry were really cool and hearing how people came into development from non-traditional career paths was interesting.
