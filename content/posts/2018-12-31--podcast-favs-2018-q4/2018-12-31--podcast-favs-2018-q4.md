Another few months have passed and I have a few more podcasts to share that piqued my interest. This time around I'm going to focus on one group of podcasts from [Changelog](https://changelog.com/).

 1. [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast) with Adam Stacoviak and Jerod Santo. They talk with various leaders and innovators from the software development world. The best episode that I feels really encompasses what The Changelog is all about is [310](https://changelog.com/podcast/310) where they talk with Ben Halpern the founder and of dev.to an online community for software developers.
 2. [JS Party](https://changelog.com/jsparty) with a cast of various hosts each episode. One of my favorites is episode [38](https://changelog.com/jsparty/38) - REST easy, GraphQL is here where they discuss the advantages and pitfalls of using GraphQL as well as a few other topics. 
 3. [Practical AI](https://changelog.com/practicalai) with Chris Benson and Daniel Whitenack. This podcast launched in July so there's not that many episodes yet, but they are already at 25 as of the end of 2018. What I enjoy about this one is the real world examples of AI being used to help people do real things. My favorite episode so far was episode [3](https://changelog.com/practicalai/3) - Helping African farmers with  . They talk about an app being used by farmers in Africa to take pictures of their crop and identify if they have any diseases.
