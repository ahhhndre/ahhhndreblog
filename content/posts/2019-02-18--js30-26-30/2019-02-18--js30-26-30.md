This is a series of posts going over the free [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) course by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/) that gets you to work through 30 vanilla (no framework) JavaScript ideas. Each post will cover a few days from the course. This is totally free and well worth taking a try at. As someone who hasn't used JavaScript much in the last few years it was a great way to get myself rolling again and see all the cool things you can do with what's built into the browser!

For reference each of the day comes with a set of files to start from - CSS and HTML was prebuilt. I just added the JavaScript.

Day 26 - [Stripe Follow Along Nav](https://demos.ahhhndre.ca/JavaScript30/26-Stripe-Follow-Along-Nav)

- we created a follow along nav like Stripe and when you hover on an item a larger dropdown opens
- entering the hover has two parts, we add a class first and then after a timeout period we add another class. This allows us to be sure they are hovering for a bit and also allows us to show a nice transition effect
- when they leave we just remove the classes

Day 27 - [Click and Drag](https://demos.ahhhndre.ca/JavaScript30/27-Click-and-Drag/)

- this one we worked with some complex CSS to show an accordion like page
- we used a lot of coordinates, offsets, and scroll information to make this all work

Day 28 - [Video Speed Controller](https://demos.ahhhndre.ca/JavaScript30/28-Video-Speed-Controller)

- another example using the video element, this time we wanted to be able to speed up or slow it down using a slider
- to accomplish this we used the playbackRate property on the video element
- we also setup a ratio between the slider and the min and max playback rate we defined

Day 29 - [Countdown Timer](https://demos.ahhhndre.ca/JavaScript30/29-Countdown-Timer)

- we used setInterval and clearInterval to create a countdown timer
- this is another case where string literals came in handy to break apart the minutes and seconds
- also did some work with the ternary operator to help with adding the leading zero when needed

Day 30 - [Whack A Mole](https://demos.ahhhndre.ca/JavaScript30/30-Whack-A-Mole)

- the final day we built a little Whack-A-Mole game!
- we used random to somewhat randomize where the moles will pop-up but with only 6 spots it's not very good so we added a check to make sure it's not the same hole as before and this helped
- the isTrusted property on the event let's you know if the click was from the user or something else like a script
