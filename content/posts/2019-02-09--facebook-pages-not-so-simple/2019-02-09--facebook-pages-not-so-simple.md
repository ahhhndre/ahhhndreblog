I've stater to volunteer for SLAM (Sierra Leon Action Mission) at the beginning of the year. SLAM currently helps keep an orphanage running in Sierra Leon and are working on getting a school built on the same compound. Seeing as I'm an IT guy I offered my help with that. My first task was to help post things to their Facebook page. This turned out to be harder than I thought.

My first crack at this was to go to the SLAM Facebook page and find an option to request access to the page. This is what I had seen done years ago but had never done myself. Well after searching high and low I wasn't able to find anything to do this. So I moved on to do some google searching on the topic. Noe everything I found lead me to the Facebook Business Manager support documentation and I just didn't think that was the right thing for this. So I kept looking and kept coming up with nothing.

I finally broke down and started to read more of the Business Manage support docs. It ends up that yes this is where you need to go to request access to a Page on Facebook. I had to create my own Business Manager profile and create a page for it, which I did. At this point I could now request access to other pages. I searched for the SLAM page and sent off my request. This sent an email to the person who is currently responsible for the page but was not super tech savvy and wanted me to take over for him. He got the email and approved my access - I am now the admin for the SLAM Facebook page and can post and update things as needed. I can also add other in various roles which might come in handy in the future.

I'm not sure why Facebook designed pages to work this way as I know have another profile to manage. Hopefully as I learn more about this there will be a way to make this easier to work with down the road. But now I have a page and profile I can use for future projects of my own.
