I just finished listening to the Syntax. podcast on Design Systems ([Episode 56](https://syntax.fm/show/056/design-systems)). It really has me fired up because at work we really have a mess when it comes to our brands. I work for a Pet Insurance company and we help support 9 different brands with 2 of those being in-house. There’s no real standard for each so we have customer facing applications that have no consistency within a given brand and our communications touch-points with customers lack consistency. I think there’s a chance that building a Design System for all out brands would greatly improve both of these areas. This will create a single source of truth for how a site or application or letter or email should look and what the tone should be.

But what is a Design System? In it's simplest form it's a inventory of everything about your brand(s) - colors, fonts, buttons, logos, etc. Using this inventory you can then apply the same look and feel across all your properties. This makes it easy for your customers to navigate your sites as they have a consistent feel but also allows developers to build things faster. They can grab components to build up new apps! For example [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) supports Angular, React and Vue to do exactly this.

If you want to learn more about Design Systems here are a few of the resources that I found to be the most helpful:

- [Design Systems Repo](https://designsystemsrepo.com/) has an amazing collection of information on tools, articles, books and talks
- [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) by Brad Frost is a great read and gives you a really clear explanation of what Design Systems are and how he creates them using his Atomic Design method. [Pattern Lab](https://patternlab.io/) is a design system tool that uses this method
- [Atlassian Design](https://atlassian.design/) is the design system for Atlassian makers of Jira, Confluence and BitBucket. It's a really well designed site,easy to navigate, and shows you the tremendous value of having a design system that everyone can work from.
