Welcome to my new blog, this is something that I have been wanting to do for some time now but I just kept putting it off and procrastinating. Well the time has finally come and here it is. The goal is to write one post a week every week. I think this will be a fairly easy accomplishment but I'm not sure if I will get schedule right but I think it's better to have a goal then to have nothing at all. Some of the topics I plan to cover are:

- Front-end development like React, Vue, static site generators, JavaScript, etc.
- Back-end development like PHP Laravel, .NET MVC, Web APIs, etc.
- DevOps practices and tools like Blue Green deployments, CI, CD, Azure DevOps, etc.
- Learning resources like books I've read or podcasts I've listened to or tutorials I've completed
- Building projects that I'm working on like To Do Flow, Emoji Streak, Holiday Meal Calendar, etc.

I think that as this grows there will be useful posts for anyone from the development community. In the end if I can help someone find a solution to a problem that I've had and written a post about then I feel like I would have returned the favor to the many blog posts I've read that helped me in my time of need.
