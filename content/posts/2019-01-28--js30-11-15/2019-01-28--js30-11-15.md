This is a series of posts going over the free [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) course by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/) that gets you to work through 30 vanilla (no framework) JavaScript ideas. Each post will cover a few days from the course. This is totally free and well worth taking a try at. As someone who hasn't used JavaScript much in the last few years it was a great way to get myself rolling again and see all the cool things you can do with what's built into the browser!

For reference each of the day comes with a set of files to start from - CSS and HTML was prebuilt. I just added the JavaScript.

Day 11 - [Custom Video Player](https://demos.ahhhndre.ca/JavaScript30/11-Custom-Video-Player)

- got to work with the video element and added a bunch of features - play, skip, scrub, etc.
- used the conditional (ternary) operator, for example:

```javascript
const state = this.paused ? "Play" : "Pause";
```

- you can use square brackets and the method name as a string to call a method, for example:

```javascript
const method = video.paused ? "play" : "pause";
video[method]();
```

Day 12 - [Key Sequence Detection](https://demos.ahhhndre.ca/JavaScript30/12-Key-Sequence-Detection)

- having some fun with key detection, if you type "webos" all together in the demo you'll get a surprise
- used splice to keep the same number of items in the array as the length of the secret code
- using join('') on an array will give you a string without commas between the items whereas if you use toString you will get a string but there will be commas between each item

Day 13 - [Slide in on Scroll](https://demos.ahhhndre.ca/JavaScript30/13-Slide-in-on-Scroll)

- introduced the debounce pattern to help with performance, I plan to write a whole post on this
- this one has a lot of position checking to tell if the image is visible or not using: scrollY and offsetTop

Day 14 - JavaScript References Vs. Copying

- no demo here as we are going over references and copying
- if you are working with variables and you create a new variable and set it to an existing variable and update the new one the old one will not change. This is not the case with arrays
- this is a good time to use the new spread operator introduced with ES6, for example:

```javascript
const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];
const team = [...players];
```

Day 15 - [LocalStorage](https://demos.ahhhndre.ca/JavaScript30/15-LocalStorage)

- learned about using preventDefault to stop the page from reloading unnecessarily
- local storage only works with strings so you'll need to use JSON.stringify()
- to get items from local storage use getItems(), to save items use setItems(), and to delete something use removeItem()
