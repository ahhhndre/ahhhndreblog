This is a series of posts going over the free [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) course by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/) that gets you to work through 30 vanilla (no framework) JavaScript ideas. Each post will cover a few days from the course. This is totally free and well worth taking a try at. As someone who hasn't used JavaScript much in the last few years it was a great way to get myself rolling again and see all the cool things you can do with what's built into the browser!

For reference each of the day comes with a set of files to start from - CSS and HTML was prebuilt. I just added the JavaScript.

Day 1 - [JavaScript Drum Kit](https://demos.ahhhndre.ca/javascript30/1-javascript-drum-kit)

- if you want to know what key codes are use [keycode.info](https://keycode.info)
- introduced string literals which is new in ES6 - you use back ticks (to the left of the number 1 key on your keyboard) and then "\${}" to put in any variables you'd like
- used data attributes which are part of the HTML standard allowing you to create your own attributes but they must begin with "data-"
- getting objects from the document is much easier using document.querySelector and document.querySelectorAll
- got to work with the audio HTML element and see how easy it is to use with JS
- setting the currentTime property to 0 will allow you to quickly restart the audio otherwise it plays the whole thing before allowing it to play again

Day 2 - [CSS + JS Clock](https://demos.ahhhndre.ca/javascript30/)

- this one eded up being more about CSS then JS but was still interesting
- using transform-origin 100% will make the pivot point at the very end, by default this is 50%, when doing transform rotate
- transition-timing-function has some prebuilt effects or you can customize it, in this case we hacked the cubic-bezier in dev tools and now it looks like a more mechanical watch hand
- used setInterval which allows us to run a function continuously after a specified interval between runs

Day 3 - [Playing with CSS Variables and JS](https://demos.ahhhndre.ca/javascript30/)

- another one where we learned a bit more on CSS than JS but again still learning
- css variables must be declared on an element
- css variables start with a double dash, for example --variableName
- to use css variables you use var(--variableName)
- when you use querySelectorAll you get back a NodeList which looks a lot like an Array but is not

Day 4 - Array Cardio Day 1

- there is no demo for this one as it's all in the console
- went over filter, map, sort, and reduce using various examples
- filter allows you to filter down an array to specific criteria
- map allows you to loop through the array and make changes producing a new array with your changes
- sort does what it says, sorts your array
- reduce allows you to sum up all the items in an array

Day 5 - [Flex Panels Image Gallery](https://demos.ahhhndre.ca/javascript30/)

- played with toggling on and off CSS classes using JS
- added event listeners using forEach
- learned about the transitionend event which is fired when a CSS transition ends
