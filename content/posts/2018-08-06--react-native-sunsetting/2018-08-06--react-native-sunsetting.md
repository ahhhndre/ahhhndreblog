I really found that episodes [129](http://fragmentedpodcast.com/episodes/129) and [130](http://fragmentedpodcast.com/episodes/130) of the Fragmented podcast to be really interesting. The have as a guest Gabriel Peal from Airbnb come on and talk about why they are moving away from React Native. Most of these two episodes were driven by a few [blog posts](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/react-native-at-airbnb-f95aa460be1c) and the Fragmented hosts dive into a series of questions that get to the details that were missing.

I found it interesting to learn about how Airbnb came to use React Native and how they came to the conclusion that they were better suited moving away from the framework. I personally have felt that build once, run anywhere is a bit of a pipe dream and that the solutions for this have too many trade offs. There is a place for these frameworks but I’ve generally found they are few and far between.

I was also excited by how they episodes felt like going under the covers at Airbnb and being a fly on the wall of their decision making process. I learned a lot about how much deciding on a framework can really impact a company. It's not something that can be taken lightly.

I highly recommend you give these two episodes your time and I would also recommend you subscribe to the Fragmented podcast while you're at it!
