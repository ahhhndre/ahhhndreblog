I've been working through the Gatsby JS tutorials to get a simple shell of a blog up. Gatsby JS is a static site generator built using some pretty cool tech - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, GraphQL, and Markdown. As I've been doing this one name that kept coming up was [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Netlify is a cloud based company that provides serverless hosting for static sites. Their free tier is pretty amazing. I was able to setup an account, point it at my GitHub repo, build my Gatsby JS project, and deploy the results in about 10 minutes. Oh, and adding a custom domain and an SSL certificate from Lets Encrypt was only another 5 minutes!

The other super cool feature for me is that, out of the box and without me needing to do any extra configuring, Netlify will automatically update based on me pushing updates to my GitHub repo! It's like I have a mini CI and CD pipeline and I barely did anything.
