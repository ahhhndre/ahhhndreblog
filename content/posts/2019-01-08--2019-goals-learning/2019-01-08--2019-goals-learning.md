In my previous post on my goals for 2019 I'd like to expand on a few of the sections to help myself set clear objectives. In the Learning section I outlined some things I really want to learn in 2019: modern JavaScript, Laravel, Vue, React, Gatsby and Docker. 

Modern JavaScript runs the web, it's as simple as that. Before I can dive into some of my other goals in 2019 I need to be proficient in JavaScript. To do this I'm going to start out by completing a refresher course - [Introduction to JavaScript](https://scrimba.com/g/gintrotojavascript) - to refresh my knowledge. Then I try my hand at the [30 Days of JavaScript](https://javascript30.com/) and finish up with [ES6 for Everyone](https://es6.io/) which should give me a solid foundation for the rest of the year. As I don't have a specific output for these I'm going to create a showcase of all the things I build as a page off my resume website.

Over the summer I started to learn Laravel and I'd like to keep up with that as well as combine it with Vue. To accomplish this I'm going to focus on finishing the [Laravel from Scratch](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2017) Laracast then work through [Learn Vue: Step by Step](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-vue-2-step-by-step), [Testing Laravel](https://laracasts.com/series/phpunit-testing-in-laravel), and [Testing Vue](https://laracasts.com/series/testing-vue) courses. At this point I should be able to take on my To Do Flow web application Build goal.

One of the goals that ties everything together, by making me write everything down and post it, is my goal to learn React using Gatsby a static site generator. I've already started on this goal by pushing out an existing Gatsby Starter site so that my writing can be seen. To further this goal I will also complete the [Gatsby tutorials](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) and the [Pro Gatsby 2](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/pro-gatsby-2) course. I will then be able to deconstruct, rebuild and expand this site using the knowledge I've gained leading to the completion of my Blog Build goal.

The last learning goal I have for 2019 is to learn Docker. I don't have a good understanding of how to combine Docker and applications but the concept intrigues me. Combining some of the new things I've learned I will complete the [Docker for PHP Developers](https://bitpress.io/docker-for-php-developers/) course. Then I will apply Docker to my To Do Flow application towards my Build goal to Containerize To Do Flow.
