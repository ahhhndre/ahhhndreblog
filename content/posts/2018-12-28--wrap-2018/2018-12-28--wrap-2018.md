Another year is coming to an end and it's time to look back at what I've accomplished this year:

- January - joined the Maple Grove Park Dog Owners' Association (MGPDOA) as a member-at-large and took on helping with their IT needs. Also launched [OVMA Pet Insurance](https://www.ovmapetinsurance.com/) at work, which has been a game changer
- February - got into hardware mode and installed a vent for my dryer and an [Ecobee3](https://www.ecobee.com/) smart thermostat
- March - hit the ten year mark at my current employer
- April - launched the new MGPDOA [website](https://maplegrovedogpark.ca/)
- May - enjoyed some time away from the computer and out at the dog park
- June - headed to Toronto with my team from work for a town-hall and managed to catch a Blue Jay's game as a team before heading home
- July - started a journey to decide what direction to take my career by reading more, listening to podcasts, and getting into some coding projects
- August - built up my Homelab server and launched a new Pet Insurance brand - [Peppermint](https://www.mypeppermint.ca/) - at work
- September - took a long vacation in the Netherlands visiting my sister
- October - enjoyed time with family for Thanksgiving
- November - started and ended this month with trips to Toronto and Kirchner Waterloo for DR (Disaster Recovery) exercises with work. Got to see my first live NBA game - [Raptors vs. Warriors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=290z2FhsC2o&feature=onebox)!
- December - had a relaxing time with family over the Christmas season

Overall 2018 was a goo year for me and I'm looking to keep that going in 2019!
