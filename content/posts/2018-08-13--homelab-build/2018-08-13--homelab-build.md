All the parts have shown up for my Homelab server that I talked about in my post here. It's been a long time since I've built a computer from the ground up and I'm pretty excited about it. I'm not going into details on every step so here are some of the highlights:

- Take everything out of the box and layout all the parts, I found this made it a lot easier to see the big picture
- Make sure you order the right case, I had all the parts a while ago but the case I first ordered was the wrong one and would not fit a server size motherboard
- Double and triple check everything before you do it. I had to take out the motherboard a few times to get things in place or to redo something and it's not an easy process - so many screws!
- Less is more when it comes to the silicon paste on the CPU. This gets pressed between the fan and the CPU and will spread because of the pressure. You don't want it spilling everywhere
- Take you time and try not to rush, I let my excitement get the best of me and had to redo things here and there
