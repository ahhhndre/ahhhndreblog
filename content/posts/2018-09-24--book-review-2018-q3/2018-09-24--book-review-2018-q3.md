Over the summer I realized that I had a large collection of books that I haven't read yet. I setup a simple Kanban board, or piles in this case, in a visible location in the house with piles for Ready, Doing and Done. The idea was that having to see the big pile of Ready books and the empty Done spot would motivate me to get reading. So far I think it has as I have read 6 books in the last three months. 

Here they are in no particular order along with some of my thoughts:

 - [Lean Enterprise](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030355.do) - I've written a more detailed review, you can read it here
 - [The Clean Coder](https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073) - I also wrote a more detail review here
 - [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer) - I think after reading The Clean Coder this might have been too much of the same as I didn't really get anything from this
 - [The Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month) - This one was interesting from a more historical context, the essays are good reads if you'd like to know what the thinking about software development was like 40 years ago
 - [Laravel: Up and Running](https://laravelupandrunning.com/) - Great way to start learning about Laravel in book format
 - [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-design-book/) - This continued my quest for more knowledge about Design Systems and it provides a lot of answers
